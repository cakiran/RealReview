#Use case:#
We all read reviews and there are many of them for a given restaurant or any other business entity. How can we get a real sense of how the business is doing and how their services are? Yes we can spend time and read all the reviews ourselves to get the real picture that is being presented by all the reviews or you can use RealReview an AI based WPF app which will read all the reviews of the business for you and give you an aggregated score which will accurately reflect the holistic picture presented by all the reviewers in the reviews.
